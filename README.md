*GLORiA Dataset*

The **GLORiA Dataset** is an image collection designed for the study and classification of fish according to their **origin**. It includes images of three highly relevant species in aquaculture and fisheries:  

- **Argyrosomus regius** (*meagre*)  
- **Dicentrarchus labrax** (*European seabass*)  
- **Sparus aurata** (*gilthead seabream*)  

Each specimen is categorized into three groups based on its provenance:  

- **C** → Captive (aquaculture)  
- **E** → Escaped (individuals that escaped from farms into the wild)  
- **W** → Wild  

The dataset is organized in species- and class-specific folders and also includes **processed and augmented versions** for use in computer vision tasks such as automatic classification, deep learning experiments, and comparative studies between wild and farmed fish.

## ✨ Main Goals
- Provide an open resource for research on **fish classification**.  
- Enable the study of morphological differences between **wild, farmed, and escaped fish**.  
- Contribute to projects on **AI for aquaculture and sustainability**.
